### Step up your CSS game:
- SCSS
  - This version is designed for css3 (the css version that is commonly used today)
  - Commonly referred to as SASS (the name of the original version before css3)
    - Specifically known as SCSS or SASS3
  - Complies down to a single css file, and makes css easier to work with.
  - This is a superset of css, if you can write css you can write scss
    - All you have to learn is how to compile
